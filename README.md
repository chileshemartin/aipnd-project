# AI Programming with Python Project by Udacity

Final project files project files for creating own image classifer for 102 different flowers.
This is part of the requirements for completing the Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. 
In this project, I build an image classifier using PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
